# BLINKIT-DASHBOARD
Project: BlinkIt Sales Dashboard
🔗 Tech Stack: HTML, CSS, SQL

I designed and developed a fully functional BlinkIt Sales Dashboard to visualize and manage sales and delivery data.

🖥️ Frontend (HTML/CSS):
Built a responsive and user-friendly interface using HTML5 and CSS3. Styled with background images, overlays, and a clean layout for easy navigation and a professional look. Employed CSS Flexbox/Grid and media queries for device responsiveness.

🗄️ Backend (SQL):
Structured the backend using SQL to manage customer, product, order, delivery, and sales data. Implemented:

Complex SQL queries (JOINs, GROUP BY, aggregate functions)
Views, Stored Procedures, and Triggers
Real-time analytics on orders, stock, and delivery metrics
🎯 Outcome:
The dashboard provides a streamlined way to monitor BlinkIt's operations, showcasing a complete integration of frontend design with robust backend logic.
